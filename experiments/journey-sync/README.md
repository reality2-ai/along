# Saved-journey synchronization data layer

Experimental local data model and durable storage, not an enabled sync feature.
The public app and published pairing lab do not import these modules. No data is
sent to a peer, provider or server by this layer.

`state.mjs` stores one register per ordered endpoint pair. Each register contains
the endpoint records and chosen service preferences, or a deletion tombstone.
`projectJourney` explicitly selects those fields from the planner's richer objects;
learning counts, time/day patterns, precise current location, active form, app
screen, credentials and accessibility settings are not included. Saved endpoint
addresses are private data and must only be transferred after deliberate consent.
Stop IDs are resolved against the receiving planner's local network; a stored
address coordinate is not proof of an accessible entrance.

Registers use a Lamport counter and actor identifier, with the actor breaking
ties. Changes observe the highest received counter before advancing it; wall-clock
time is unused. Independent endpoint pairs merge independently. Concurrent edits
to the same pair use this deterministic ordering, including a concurrent save and
delete. This is not a general remove-wins policy. An old snapshot cannot resurrect
a later deletion; a deliberate save after observing that deletion can restore it.
The pair's endpoints and route preference are one value, not field-level merges.

Deletion tombstones are retained indefinitely in this version. The limit is 256
distinct pairs, including tombstones; exceeding it refuses the change rather than
silently dropping history. A future retention/compaction protocol must account for
offline devices before removing tombstones. Forget-history generations and learned
history synchronization are separate unfinished work. Unknown schema/fields,
wrong groups, invalid endpoints, inconsistent retained operation stamps and
counter exhaustion are rejected. This is bounded schema validation, not protection
against a malicious group member or restored copies of old browser storage.

`store.mjs` uses the existing browser storage adapter's compare-and-swap transaction
to persist the clock, visible register state and outbound snapshot together. It
retries concurrent writers against the latest state. It reports a saved receipt
only after the storage adapter reports commit. Cancellation and storage failures
do not authorize discarding an earlier saved copy. No read silently replaces an
unknown existing schema. The snapshot is sufficient for later retransmission;
there is no volatile-only outbound queue.

The constructor's group and actor are caller-supplied context. The future adapter
must derive them from the verified local persona and bind each incoming snapshot
to an authenticated, authorized group session. `merge` does **not** authenticate
its caller. Do not expose it directly to network messages. At-rest records use the
same browser-origin boundary as the current personal preferences; this module
does not encrypt journey data or establish protection from same-origin scripts.

Verification:

```sh
node --test experiments/journey-sync/state.test.mjs
CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chromium node experiments/journey-sync/store.test.mjs
```

The browser check uses the recorded runtime bundle described in
[the build procedure](../../docs/PAIRING_LICENSE_AUDIT.md#recorded-runtime-rebuild-24-september-2026).
It exercises actual IndexedDB transactions through two simultaneous handles,
deletion/replay, a fresh-document reopen, and cancelled/failed/invalid changes.
Model checks cover reordered three-replica convergence and privacy projection.
This does not yet establish authenticated peer delivery, receipt exchange,
automatic reconciliation, preference migration, public UI or physical-device use.
